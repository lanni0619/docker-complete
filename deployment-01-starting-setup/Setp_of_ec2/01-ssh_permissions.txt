On WSL, chmod donesn't work on NTFS partitions used by Windows. 
You need to move your .pem file to a partition in Linux container (for example the home folder), 
then chmod 400 will work.

Navigate to a NTFS folder, example 
=> cd /mnt/d/docker/deployment-01-starting-setup

Move .pem file to your home folder
=> mv /mnt/d/docker/deployment-01-starting-setup/example-1.pem ~

Navigate to your folder: 
=> cd ~

Apply the permission: 
=> chmod 400 key.pem

Connect to remote machine:
=> ssh -i "example-1.pem" ec2-user@ec2-3-106-237-3.ap-southeast-2.compute.amazonaws.com
